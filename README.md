Can happiness of people be predicted by measurable statistics from where they live? To answer this question, we found data from 2021 on the GDP per capita, how free they feel to make life choices, social support available, and life expectancy.

Data was taken from the World Happiness Report - https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/
