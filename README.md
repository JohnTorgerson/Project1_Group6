## Topic: Characteristics of happy nations

### Overview
Use the data in the World Happiness Report to understand the forces affecting happiness. We seek to understand how differing levels of social support, freedom, GDP, and life expectancy affect happiness across the globe.

# Project 1 Requirements
These are the requirements for Project 1. 

### Grading
This project will be graded by your TAs and me, and grading will be both objective (e.g., how well did you satisfy the requirements) and subjective (i.e., how well you did you do compared to the other groups in the class). You will also have an opportunity to provide confidential feedback about the members of your group. 

### Additional time
This project usually requires students to spend additional time outside of class hours, so please plan and prepare for that. 

### Project Schedule

* Thursday (7/28): Branching in Git, project kick-off, group time
* Monday (8/1): Merging in Git, group time, proposals due at the end of class 
* Tuesday (8/2): Hypothesis testing, group time
* Thursday (8/4): All group time; brief announcements when class begins
* Monday (8/8): All group time; brief announcements when class begins
* Tuesday (8/9): **Project Presentations**


## Proposal Requirements
Please assume the proposal is the **_starting point for a discussion_** with me, and please anticipate a variety of questions about your topic, your dataset(s), and the way you plan to divide the work. My whole goal in this discussion is to ensure that you're set up for success and you're not attempting to do more than you can handle in the time provided. I won't allow you to move forward until I approve your proposal, so please DO NOT wait until the last minute to choose your topic. 

1. You must submit your project proposal directly to me, via direct message on Slack (not email), no later than the end of the class specified above.  
1. Your proposal may be written in either a Google Doc (in which case you'll send me a link that has sharing enabled) or directly in Slack.
1. Your proposal must be readable, grammatically correct, and well formatted. Most proposals typically range from half a page to two pages in length, but there's no requirement for this.
1. Your proposal must include the following: 
    * Group number
    * List of all group members
    * Topic
    * A brief overview of what you plan to do
    * Two to four research questions to answer; i.e., what will you investigate? 
    * The hypothesis you intend to test or the regression you intend to perform
    * Links to the specific dataset(s) you plan to use. Note: it is NOT ok to say, "we'll find a dataset that includes ...." You must commit to your dataset(s) before I approve your proposal. 
    * Work breakdown or list of major tasks

### Example
Here's a simple idea for a proposal. Your proposal may look similar or different; it's up to you. As described above, your proposal will need a lot of additional detail as well: 
> Our project is to uncover patterns in criminal activity around Los Angeles. We'll examine relationships between types of crime and location; crime rates and times of day; trends in crime rates over the course of the year; and related questions, as the data admits.


## Technical Requirements
1. Your project must use at least one dataset. You may optionally use more than one dataset, but I encourage you to _keep it simple_. 

1. Your dataset must be no larger than 90 MB (to remain compliant with GitHub's limits). If your datset is larger than this, you'll have to shrink it with Pandas (not Excel) before using it on your project. 

1. Your project must use Pandas to clean and format your data. Excel is not permitted. 

1. You project must have one Jupyter Notebook that describes, and contains all code for, the **data exploration and cleanup** process.

1. Your project must have another Jupyter Notebook contains the **final data analysis**.

1. Your project must use Matplotlib to create six to eight visualizations of your data (ideally, at least two per "question" you ask of your data). 

1. Your project may pull data from an API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions. An API is not required.  

1. Your project must have a write-up that summarizes its major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.

1. Your project must include at least one hypothesis test or at least one linear regression. (We'll discuss Hypothesis Testing at a later date. See above.)

1. Your project team must have a single shared repo that contains all code and data files used for the project. All group members must be included as collaborators on that repo. At the end of the project, all group members will submit a link to this shared repo. 

## Presentation Requirements and Guidelines
I always describe the presentations as Show & Tell. I'll say more about this over the next few classes, but here are some general requirements and guidelines. 

1. Requirement: due to the large class size, your presentation must last no longer than 14 minutes, and all group members must present something.

1. Requirement: all group members must have their cameras on while the group presents. (You're supposed to have your cameras on anyway, but you'll fail the project if you don't.)

1. Guideline: describe the topic and (optionally) the hypothesis for your project.

1. Guideline: describe the questions your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them.

1. Guideline: summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions.

1. Guideline: briefly describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook).

1. Guideline: briefly describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook).

1. Guideline: briefly summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations that show these results. 

1. Guideline: briefly discuss anything you'd do differently next time or any important lessons learned.
